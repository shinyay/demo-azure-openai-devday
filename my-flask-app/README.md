│   ├── app.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── routes.py

├── requirements.txt
├── config.py
└── README.md
```

## Files

- `src/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that marks the `src` directory as a Python package.

- `src/app.py`: This file is the entry point of the Flask application. It creates an instance of the Flask app and sets up routes and configurations.

- `src/models.py`: This file contains the models for the Flask application. It may define classes representing database tables or other data structures.

- `src/routes.py`: This file contains the route handlers for the Flask application. It defines functions or classes that handle HTTP requests and return responses.

- `src/templates/index.html`: This file is an example template file for the Flask application. It may contain HTML code with placeholders for dynamic content.

- `tests/test_app.py`: This file contains the unit tests for the Flask application. It may include test cases for the routes and models.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies required for the Flask application. It specifies the packages and their versions.

- `config.py`: This file contains the configuration settings for the Flask application. It may include variables for database connection, secret keys, or other application-specific settings.

## Setup

To set up and run the Flask application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-flask-app.git`

2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Run the Flask application: `python src/app.py`

6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to see the application in action.
